//tab at the end of file instead of \n? both asms work with \t right now; 
//

//where are the files supposed to go if one runs the pogramme from a different directory?

//do i need to check the file size?
//set the right buffer size

//check included system headers
//malloc return value checks? use mallokill consistently?
//ft_memchr() memccpy() send off compiler warnings;

//add checks for add to buffer calls, since it cant call invoke_error anymore

//TESTING ROAD MAP
//why_atol is suspicious as fuck; 
//test number arguments in different byte ranges with different signs; make it systematic !
//leaks on invalid input?
//scuffed filenames? short, empty?
//.cor consisting of two champs?

//print errors on the str_err

//label_chars checks LABEL@~!
//invalid files memory leaks .cor and .s
//.cor files as .s
//check-list

//check arg count
//giant files?
//buffer overflow

//-n nonexistant files


//display usage?



//should i be paranoid about exit() in case of malloc failure?
//dont give retards an inch
